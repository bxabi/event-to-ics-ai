There are 2 GUI version available, you can either use tkinter or QT.
QT has more features, but if you don't yet use it, it is a large package to install.
Tkinter looks less good but it is small. It needs the tkinter package to be installed besides the pytho requirements.

So run one of them: 
- pip install -r requirements-tkinter.txt
- OR
- pip install -r requirements-QT.txt


- create a '.env' file and add you openai API key as OPENAI_API_KEY=...

Alternatively you can also try/use the online version: https://event-ai.bxabi.com
